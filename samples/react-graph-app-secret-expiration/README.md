# Applications Secrets Expiration

## Summary

This sample web part shows the list of your applications registered in Azure AD along with their associated client secret/certificate expiration date.
I got the idea from this great article [Use Power Automate to Notify of Upcoming Azure AD App Client Secrets and Certificate Expirations](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/use-power-automate-to-notify-of-upcoming-azure-ad-app-client/ba-p/2406145) and thought it would be nice to have a SPFx web part version of it.
