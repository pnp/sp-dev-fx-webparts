# sp-polyfills
A "polyfill" is a script that emulates a modern JavaScript feature when it is not available in an older web browser.
The sp-polyfills package provides standard polyfills for the specific feature set that the SharePoint Framework
expects from its environment.  It is acceptable for a browser environment (e.g. a unit test runner) to load its own
polyfills, but they must be equivalent to the definitions in this package.

*This package is part of the [SharePoint Framework](http://aka.ms/spfx),
which is a collection of NPM packages that empower developers to create client-side experiences
for [Microsoft SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration).
