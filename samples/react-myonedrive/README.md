## Prerequisites

* SharePoint Online tenant
* You have provided permission in SharePoint admin for accessing Graph API on behalf of your solution. We can do it before deployment as proactive steps, or after deployment. You can refer to [steps about how to do this post-deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/use-aad-tutorial#deploy-the-solution-and-grant-permissions). Basically you have to use API Access Page of SharePoint admin and add below permission for our use case. 

```
 "webApiPermissionRequests": [
      {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Files.Read"
      },
      {
        "resource": "Microsoft Graph",
        "scope": "Files.Read.All"
      }
    ]

```
