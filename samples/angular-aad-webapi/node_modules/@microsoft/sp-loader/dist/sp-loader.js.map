The\n      primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n      registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n      why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      Terminology\n      -----------\n\n      - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n      - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n      - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n      - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n      - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n      - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n      A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n      Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n      state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n      rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n      Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n      promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n      settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n      itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n      itself fulfill.\n\n\n      Basic Usage:\n      ------------\n\n      ```js\n      var promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n        // on success\n        resolve(value);\n\n        // on failure\n        reject(reason);\n      });\n\n      promise.then(function(value) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Usage:\n      ---------------\n\n      Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n      `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n      ```js\n      function getJSON(url) {\n        return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n          var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n          xhr.open('GET', url);\n          xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n          xhr.responseType = 'json';\n          xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n          xhr.send();\n\n          function handler() {\n            if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n              if (this.status === 200) {\n                resolve(this.response);\n              } else {\n                reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n              }\n            }\n          };\n        });\n      }\n\n      getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n        // on fulfillment\n      }, function(reason) {\n        // on rejection\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n      ```js\n      Promise.all([\n        getJSON('/posts'),\n        getJSON('/comments')\n      ]).then(function(values){\n        values[0] // => postsJSON\n        values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n        return values;\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @class Promise\n      @param {function} resolver\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @constructor\n    */\n    function lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise(resolver) {\n      this._id = lib$es6$promise$promise$$counter++;\n      this._state = undefined;\n      this._result = undefined;\n      this._subscribers = [];\n\n      if (lib$es6$promise$$internal$$noop !== resolver) {\n        typeof resolver !== 'function' && lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsResolver();\n        this instanceof lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise ? lib$es6$promise$$internal$$initializePromise(this, resolver) : lib$es6$promise$promise$$needsNew();\n      }\n    }\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.all = lib$es6$promise$promise$all$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.race = lib$es6$promise$promise$race$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.resolve = lib$es6$promise$promise$resolve$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.reject = lib$es6$promise$promise$reject$$default;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setScheduler = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setScheduler;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._setAsap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$setAsap;\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise._asap = lib$es6$promise$asap$$asap;\n\n    lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise.prototype = {\n      constructor: lib$es6$promise$promise$$Promise,\n\n    /**\n      The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n      which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n      reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function(user){\n        // user is available\n      }, function(reason){\n        // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Chaining\n      --------\n\n      The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n      promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n      or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return user.name;\n      }, function (reason) {\n        return 'default name';\n      }).then(function (userName) {\n        // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n        // will be `'default name'`\n      });\n\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n      }, function (reason) {\n        throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n        // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n      });\n      ```\n      If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }).then(function (value) {\n        // never reached\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Assimilation\n      ------------\n\n      Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n      retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled.

And that is actually already a magic------What happens here is the in order to get the doclib page in ContentDB, we had a standard MondoSproc call which gets the page and the SPWeb. In constructing the web, SP *  * code has smart logic to set Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture to match the MUI language! And with that magic, =\"<%$Resources:wss,language_value%> actually gets sets properly to the user language, not the pre-defined web language.\n         * For OneDrive.aspx which lives inside _layouts folder, the order of code execution changes. We must have executed this line of ASPX code first =\"<%$Resources:wss,language_value%> before SPWeb was opened and did the magic to set Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture.\n         * So the Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture affecting =\"<%$Resources:wss,language_value%> with SPWeb magic end up not working in Onedrive.aspx! And there’s really nothing that we can do about it unless we rewrite the page!\n         * So the conclusion is that the lang attribute is by design (of implementation) different from the regular team site pages which live inside content db.\n         */\n        var language = window[\"_spPageContextInfo\"] && window[\"_spPageContextInfo\"].currentCultureName;\n        // fallback of xml:lang for IE9\n        Locale.language = language ||\n            document.documentElement.getAttribute('lang') ||\n            document.documentElement.getAttribute('xml:lang') ||\n            'en-us';\n    };\n    return Locale;\n}());\nLocale.invalidate();\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\nexports.default = Locale;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// D:/code/sp-client/common/~/rush-sp-telemetry/~/@ms/odsp-utilities/lib/locale/Locale.js\n// module id = 578\n// module chunks = 0","// OneDrive:IgnoreCodeCoverage\n\"use strict\";\nexports.strings = { \"fileSizeTB\": \"{0} TB\", \"fileSizeGB\": \"{0} GB\", \"fileSizeMB\": \"{0} MB\", \"fileSizeKB\": \"{0} KB\", \"fileSizeBytesPlural\": \"{0} bytes\", \"fileSizeBytesSingular\": \"1 byte\" };\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// D:/code/sp-client/common/~/rush-sp-telemetry/~/@ms/odsp-utilities/lib/string/StringUtilities.resx.js\n// module id = 579\n// module chunks = 0","// OneDrive:IgnoreCodeCoverage\n\"use strict\";\nvar Features_1 = require(\"../features/Features\");\nexports.HASHTAG_DISPLAY_PREFIX = \"#\";\nexports.HASHTAG_DELIMITER = \";\";\nexports.MVL_DELIMITER = \";#\";\nexports.HASHTAG_FIELD_ID = \"968052CC-891E-4197-ABBB-19C3EDFF3CD2\";\nvar Hashtags = { ODB: 581, ODC: null, Fallback: false };\nvar HashtagsUI = { ODB: 824, ODC: null, Fallback: false };\nfunction isHashtagEnabled() {\n    return Features_1.default.isFeatureEnabled(Hashtags) && Features_1.default.isFeatureEnabled(HashtagsUI);\n}\nexports.isHashtagEnabled = isHashtagEnabled;\nfunction isClientFormHashtagField(field) {\n    return (field &&\n        field.schema &&\n        isHashtagField(field.schema.FieldType, field.schema.Id));\n}\nexports.isClientFormHashtagField = isClientFormHashtagField;\nfunction isHashtagField(fieldType, fieldId) {\n    return (isHashtagEnabled() &&\n        fieldType &&\n        fieldType.toLowerCase() === \"lookupmulti\" &&\n        fieldId &&\n        fieldId.toLowerCase() === exports.HASHTAG_FIELD_ID.toLowerCase());\n}\nexports.isHashtagField = isHashtagField;\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// D:/code/sp-client/common/~/rush-sp-telemetry/~/@ms/odsp-utilities/lib/list/HashtagUtilities.js\n// module id = 580\n// module chunks = 0","\"use strict\";\nvar FileTypeIconMap_1 = require(\"./FileTypeIconMap\");\nvar ItemType_1 = require(\"./ItemType\");\nvar SharingTypeHelper = require(\"../list/SharingTypeHelper\");\nvar GENERIC_FILE = 'genericfile';\nvar CODE_FILE = 'code';\nvar ONENOTE_FILE = 'one';\nvar FOLDER = 'folder';\nvar SHARED_FOLDER = 'sharedfolder';\nvar DOCSET_FOLDER = 'docset';\nvar VIDEO_FILE = 'video';\nvar PHOTO_FILE = 'photo';\nvar LIST_ITEM = 'listitem';\nvar _extensionToIconName;\nexports.genericFile = GENERIC_FILE;\nexports.codeFile = CODE_FILE;\nexports.videoFile = VIDEO_FILE;\nexports.photoFile = PHOTO_FILE;\nfunction getIconNameFromItem(item) {\n    var iconName = '';\n    if (item.type === ItemType_1.default.Folder) {\n        iconName = SharingTypeHelper.usePrivateFolderIcon(item.sharingType) ?
