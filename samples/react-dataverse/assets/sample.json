The main goal of the project is to enhance the potential of SharePoint by integrating it with Dataverse, a low-code data platform from Microsoft.",
            "The SPFx solution will allow users to interact with data in the Dataverse environment directly from their SharePoint user interface. This allows for a more seamless and intuitive experience for end-users, who can access, manipulate, and analyze data without needing to switch between different platforms or applications."
