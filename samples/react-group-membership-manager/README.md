## Features

This app uses the Microsoft Graph to get a list of owned groups for the current user.  You can then manage the membership of that group from SharePoint/Teams.

This extension illustrates the following concepts:

- Using Fluent UI v9
- Calling the Graph natively from SPFx
- Adding/Removing Members/Owners from AAD groups
