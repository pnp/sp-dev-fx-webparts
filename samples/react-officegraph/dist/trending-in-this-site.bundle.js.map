To compensate, we cache measured values so that\r\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\r\n *\r\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\r\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\r\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\r\n */\r\nexport class List extends BaseComponent<IListProps, IListState> implements IList {\r\n  public static defaultProps = {\r\n    startIndex: 0,\r\n    onRenderCell: (item, index, containsFocus) => (<div>{ (item && item.name) || '' }</div>),\r\n    renderedWindowsAhead: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_AHEAD,\r\n    renderedWindowsBehind: DEFAULT_RENDERED_WINDOWS_BEHIND\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  public refs: {\r\n    [key: string]: React.ReactInstance,\r\n    root: HTMLElement,\r\n    surface: HTMLElement\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  private _estimatedPageHeight: number;\r\n  private _totalEstimates: number;\r\n  private _cachedPageHeights: {\r\n    [key: string]: {\r\n      height: number,\r\n      measureVersion: number\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n  private _focusedIndex: number;\r\n  private _scrollElement: HTMLElement;\r\n  private _scrollingToIndex: number;\r\n  private _hasCompletedFirstRender: boolean;\r\n\r\n  // surface rect relative to window\r\n  private _surfaceRect: IRectangle;\r\n\r\n  // The visible rect that we're required to render given the current list state.\r\n  private _requiredRect: IRectangle;\r\n\r\n  // The visible rect that we're allowed to keep rendered.
