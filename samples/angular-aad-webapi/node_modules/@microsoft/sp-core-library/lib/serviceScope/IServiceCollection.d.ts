/**
 * A shorthand pattern for extracting well-known services from a ServiceScope.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Reusable library components typically declare their service dependencies
 * by calling ServiceScope.consume() using the corresponding ServiceKey for each service.
 * For application business logic or small-sized projects, this formalism may be unnecessary
 * and would increase the learning curve for developers.  As a lightweight alternative,
 * the IServiceCollection pattern allows the common services for a particular scenario
 * to be passed around as a simple, convenient collection.
 *
 * For example, a widget feature might introduce an interface like this:
 *
 * interface IWidgetServiceCollection extends IServiceCollection {
 *   spHttpClient: SPHttpClient;
 *   widgetManager: IWidgetManager;
 * }
 *
 * Then the Widget class might initialize a "services" property, like this:
 *
 * class Widget {
 *   private _services: IWidgetServiceCollection;
 *
 *   constructor(serviceScope: ServiceScope) {
 *     serviceScope.whenFinished(() => {
 *       this._services = {
 *         serviceScope,
 *         spHttpClient: serviceScope.consume(SPHttpClient.serviceKey),
 *         widgetManager: serviceScope.consume(WidgetManager.ServiceKey),
 *       };
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 *   public get services(): IWidgetServiceCollection { return this._services; }
 * }
 *
 * For a group of components that all have these dependencies, this "services" object
 * can be passed around instead of the abstract ServiceScope.  This enables direct
 * references such as services.widgetManager, services.spHttpClient, etc.  For atypical
 * dependencies, the services.serviceScope is still available for use.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: To keep the pattern clean and understandable, IServiceCollection
 * should NOT be extended with any additional members that are not ServiceScope services.
 *
