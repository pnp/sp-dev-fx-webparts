Please do not open GitHub issues for general support questions as the GitHub list should be used for feature requests and bug reports. This way we can more easily track actual issues or bugs from the code and keep the general discussion separate from the actual code.

If you have questions about how to use SharePoint Framework or any of the provided samples, please use the following locations.

* [SharePoint Developer Space](http://aka.ms/SPPnP-Community) at http://techcommunity.microsoft.com
* [SharePoint Stack Exchange](http://sharepoint.stackexchange.com/) with 'spfx' tag

If you experience an issue with one of the provided samples [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/issues) and we'll notify the original authors of the sample.
