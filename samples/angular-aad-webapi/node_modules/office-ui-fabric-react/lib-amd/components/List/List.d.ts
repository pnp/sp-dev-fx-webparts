/**
 * The List renders virtualized pages of items. Each page's item count is determined by the getItemCountForPage callback if
 * provided by the caller, or 10 as default. Each page's height is determined by the getPageHeight callback if provided by
 * the caller, or by cached measurements if available, or by a running average, or a default fallback.
 *
 * The algorithm for rendering pages works like this:
 *
 * 1. Predict visible pages based on "current measure data" (page heights, surface position, visible window)
 * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)
 * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect
 * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously
 *
 * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that
 * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.
 *
 * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,
 * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion
 * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.
