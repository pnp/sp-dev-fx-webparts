Development
-----------

Quick commands to build and run the site from the repository root:

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Start Hugo server and the React gallery dev server (runs both in parallel):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Build the React gallery only:

```bash
npm run build:react
```

- Build the whole site (React gallery + Hugo):

```bash
npm run build
```

Notes:

- Ensure Hugo is installed and available on your PATH. On Windows you can use Chocolatey: `choco install hugo-extended`.
- The React gallery lives in `pnp-samples-gallery` and uses Vite. See `pnp-samples-gallery/package.json` for more scripts.
