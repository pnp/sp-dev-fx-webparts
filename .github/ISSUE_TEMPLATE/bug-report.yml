        Who wrote the sample?
        
        Because of the way this repository is configured, samples contributors do not get a notification when you create an issue. 
        
        For the section above **@mention any of the sample contributors**. Contributors' GitHub handle can be found on the main sample documentation page, under the "Contributors" section. 
        
        Issues without an @mention will be closed automatically, as contributors won't get notified.
        
        **NOTE:** Don't @mention the repo maintainers, they already get notified.

      When solving bugs, most time is spent going back and forth with the issue contributors asking for more information about their environment. 
      
      Save yourself some time (and those who are trying to help you); provide us with your environment information so we can reproduce the issue.
      
      We're not trying to be difficult here, we just want to help as quickly as possible.
