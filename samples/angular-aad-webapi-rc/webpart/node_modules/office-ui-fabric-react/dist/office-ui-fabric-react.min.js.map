In those cases, wrap the content wihtin a LayerHost.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * <LayerHost>\n\t *   <Layer>I will at the end of LayerHost.</Layer>\n\t *   <div>I will render normally.</div>\n\t * </LayerHost>\n\t **/\n\tvar LayerHost = (function (_super) {\n\t    __extends(LayerHost, _super);\n\t    function LayerHost(props) {\n\t        _super.call(this, props);\n\t        this.state = {\n\t            layers: []\n\t        };\n\t        this._layers = [];\n\t        this._layerRefs = {};\n\t    }\n\t    LayerHost.getDefault = function (layerElement) {\n\t        var doc = layerElement.ownerDocument;\n\t        var hostElement = doc.getElementById(DEFAULT_HOST_ID);\n\t        if (hostElement) {\n\t            return hostElement[DEFAULT_HOST_ID];\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            hostElement = doc.createElement('div');\n\t            hostElement.id = DEFAULT_HOST_ID;\n\t            doc.body.appendChild(hostElement);\n\t            var defaultHost = ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(LayerHost, {isDefault: true}), hostElement);\n\t            hostElement[DEFAULT_HOST_ID] = defaultHost;\n\t            return defaultHost;\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    LayerHost.prototype.getChildContext = function () {\n\t        return {\n\t            layerHost: this\n\t        };\n\t    };\n\t    LayerHost.prototype.render = function () {\n\t        var _this = this;\n\t        var divProps = Utilities_1.getNativeProps(this.props, Utilities_1.divProperties);\n\t        return (React.createElement(\"div\", __assign({}, divProps, {className: Utilities_1.css('ms-LayerHost', this.props.className, { 'ms-LayerHost--default': this.props.isDefault })}), \n\t            React.createElement(Fabric_1.Fabric, null, \n\t                this.props.children, \n\t                React.createElement(\"div\", {className: 'ms-LayerHost-overlay'}, this._layers.map(function (layer) { return (React.createElement(ProjectedLayer_1.ProjectedLayer, {key: layer.id, layerId: layer.id, parentElement: layer.parentElement, defaultRemoteProps: layer.props, ref: _this._resolveLayer})); })))\n\t        ));\n\t    };\n\t    LayerHost.prototype.addLayer = function (id, parentElement, props, onMounted) {\n\t        this._layers.push({\n\t            id: id,\n\t            parentElement: parentElement,\n\t            props: props,\n\t            onMounted: onMounted\n\t        });\n\t        this.forceUpdate();\n\t    };\n\t    LayerHost.prototype.removeLayer = function (id) {\n\t        var index = Utilities_1.findIndex(this._layers, function (layer) { return layer.id === id; });\n\t        if (index >= 0) {\n\t            this._layers.splice(index, 1);\n\t            delete this._layerRefs[id];\n\t            this.forceUpdate();\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    LayerHost.prototype._resolveLayer = function (projectedLayer) {\n\t        if (projectedLayer) {\n\t            var layerId_1 = projectedLayer.getId();\n\t            var index = Utilities_1.findIndex(this._layers, function (layer) { return layer.id === layerId_1; });\n\t            if (index >= 0 && this._layerRefs[layerId_1] !== projectedLayer) {\n\t                this._layerRefs[layerId_1] = projectedLayer;\n\t                this._layers[index].onMounted(projectedLayer);\n\t            }\n\t        }\n\t    };\n\t    LayerHost.childContextTypes = {\n\t        layerHost: React.PropTypes.object\n\t    };\n\t    __decorate([\n\t        Utilities_1.autobind\n\t    ], LayerHost.prototype, \"_resolveLayer\", null);\n\t    return LayerHost;\n\t}(Utilities_1.BaseComponent));\n\texports.LayerHost = LayerHost;\n\t\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=LayerHost.js.map\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 44 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\tmodule.exports = ReactDOM;\n\n/***/ },\n/* 45 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tfunction __export(m) {\n\t    for (var p in m) if (!exports.hasOwnProperty(p)) exports[p] = m[p];\n\t}\n\t__export(__webpack_require__(46));\n\t\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=Fabric.js.map\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 46 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tfunction __export(m) {\n\t    for (var p in m) if (!exports.hasOwnProperty(p)) exports[p] = m[p];\n\t}\n\t__export(__webpack_require__(47));\n\t\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 47 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\t\"use strict\";\n\tvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n\t    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n\t    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n\t    d.prototype = b === null ?

Predict visible pages based on \"current measure data\" (page heights, surface position, visible window)\n\t * 2. If changes are necessary, apply changes (add/remove pages)\n\t * 3. For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n\t * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n\t *\n\t * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly.

For pages that are added, measure the page heights if we need to using getBoundingClientRect\n * 4. If measurements don't match predictions, update measure data and goto step 1 asynchronously\n *\n * Measuring too frequently can pull performance down significantly. To compensate, we cache measured values so that\n * we can avoid re-measuring during operations that should not alter heights, like scrolling.\n *\n * However, certain operations can make measure data stale. For example, resizing the list, or passing in new props,\n * or forcing an update change cause pages to shrink/grow. When these operations occur, we increment a measureVersion\n * number, which we associate with cached measurements and use to determine if a remeasure should occur.\n */\nvar List = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(List, _super);\n    function List(props) {\n        _super.call(this, props);\n        this.state = {\n            pages: []\n        };\n        this._estimatedPageHeight = 0;\n        this._totalEstimates = 0;\n        this._requiredWindowsAhead = 0;\n        this._requiredWindowsBehind = 0;\n        // Track the measure version for everything.\n        this._measureVersion = 0;\n        // Ensure that scrolls are lazy updated.\n        this._onAsyncScroll = this._async.debounce(this._onAsyncScroll, MIN_SCROLL_UPDATE_DELAY, {\n            leading: false,\n            maxWait: MAX_SCROLL_UPDATE_DELAY\n        });\n        this._onAsyncIdle = this._async.debounce(this._onAsyncIdle, IDLE_DEBOUNCE_DELAY, {\n            leading: false\n        });\n        this._onAsyncResize = this._async.debounce(this._onAsyncResize, RESIZE_DELAY, {\n            leading: false\n        });\n        this._cachedPageHeights = {};\n        this._estimatedPageHeight = 0;\n        this._focusedIndex = -1;\n        this._scrollingToIndex = -1;\n    }\n    List.prototype.componentDidMount = function () {\n        this._updatePages();\n        this._measureVersion++;\n        this._scrollElement = scroll_1.findScrollableParent(this.refs.root);\n        this._events.on(window, 'resize', this._onAsyncResize);\n        this._events.on(this.refs.root, 'focus', this._onFocus, true);\n        if (this._scrollElement) {\n            this._events.on(this._scrollElement, 'scroll', this._onScroll);\n            this._events.on(this._scrollElement, 'scroll', this._onAsyncScroll);\n        }\n    };\n    List.prototype.componentWillReceiveProps = function (newProps) {\n        if (newProps.items !== this.props.items ||\n            newProps.renderCount !== this.props.renderCount ||\n            newProps.startIndex !== this.props.startIndex) {\n            this._measureVersion++;\n            this._updatePages(newProps);\n        }\n    };\n    List.prototype.shouldComponentUpdate = function (newProps, newState) {\n        var _a = this.props, renderedWindowsAhead = _a.renderedWindowsAhead, renderedWindowsBehind = _a.renderedWindowsBehind;\n        var oldPages = this.state.pages;\n        var newPages = newState.pages, measureVersion = newState.measureVersion;\n        var shouldComponentUpdate = false;\n        if (this._measureVersion === measureVersion &&\n            newProps.renderedWindowsAhead === renderedWindowsAhead,\n            newProps.renderedWindowsBehind === renderedWindowsBehind,\n            newProps.items === this.props.items &&\n                oldPages.length === newPages.length) {\n            for (var i = 0; i < oldPages.length; i++) {\n                var oldPage = oldPages[i];\n                var newPage = newPages[i];\n                if ((oldPage.key !== newPage.key ||\n                    oldPage.itemCount !== newPage.itemCount)) {\n                    shouldComponentUpdate = true;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            shouldComponentUpdate = true;\n        }\n        return shouldComponentUpdate;\n    };\n    List.prototype.forceUpdate = function () {\n        // Ensure that when the list is force updated we update the pages first before render.\n        this._updateRenderRects(this.props, true);\n        this._updatePages();\n        this._measureVersion++;\n        _super.prototype.forceUpdate.call(this);\n    };\n    List.prototype.render = function () {\n        var className = this.props.className;\n        var pages = this.state.pages;\n        var pageElements = [];\n        for (var i = 0; i < pages.length; i++) {\n            pageElements.push(this._renderPage(pages[i]));\n        }\n        return (React.createElement(\"div\", {ref: 'root', className: Utilities_1.css('ms-List', className)}, \n            React.createElement(\"div\", {ref: 'surface', className: 'ms-List-surface'}, pageElements)\n        ));\n    };\n    List.prototype._renderPage = function (page) {\n        var onRenderCell = this.props.onRenderCell;\n        var cells = [];\n        var pageStyle = this._getPageStyle(page);\n        for (var i = 0; page.items && i < page.items.length; i++) {\n            var item = page.items[i];\n            var itemKey = (item ?
