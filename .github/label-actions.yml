    ## Wrong or missing contributor @mentions

    Thank you for your submission, but you appear to have forgotten to @mention the sample author(s).

    To help increase your chances of getting assistance from the original authors of the sample, you should make sure to @mention the actual authors (and not the repository maintainers). 

    Make sure to include the `@` character before the GitHub username so that the author(s) get notified; using the person's name is not going to work.

    Please note that the sample authors will not get notified about this issue unless you update this issue accordingly.    

    You can find the author(s) of each sample in the sample's `README.md`, under **Solution**.

    We'll automatically close this issue in 7 days unless you update the issue.

    We'll close this issue, but if you run into further issues after you have made changes to your environment and followed the [troubreshooting steps](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/wiki/Troubleshooting-issues-with-samples), please do not hesitate to open a new issue so we can help you further.
