A Document library is created for each RFP and subfolders are created within that Library for each external supplier invited to participate in that RFP.",

General documents for the RFP that should be seen by everyone participating in the RFP can be put in the root folder of the library. General terms and conditions that everyone should see can be put at the root folder of the site."
