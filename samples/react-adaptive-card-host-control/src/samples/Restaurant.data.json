		"description": "Great concept and a wide selection of beers both on tap and bottled! Smaller wine selection than I wanted, but the variety of beers certainly made up for that. Although I didn't order anything, my boyfriend got a beer and he loved it. Their prices are fair too. \n\nThe concept is really awesome. It's a bar/store that you can bring outside food into. The place was pretty packed tonight. I wish we had stayed for more than one drink. I would have loved to sample everything!",
