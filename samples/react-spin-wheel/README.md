## Features

This web part illustrates the following concepts:

### User Experience
- **Daily Spin Limit**: Users can spin the wheel once every 24 hours
- **Probability-Based Rewards**: Configure different rewards with custom probabilities
- **Sound Effects**: Engaging audio feedback during spins using Web Audio API

### Daily Limit Enforcement

The web part checks the last spin date from the GameScores list and compares it with the current date. Users can only spin if:
- They have never spun before, OR
- Their last spin was on a different day (24+ hours ago)

### Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Load rewards from WheelRewards list
2. **Eligibility Check**: Verify user can spin today
3. **Spin Action**: Calculate winning reward using probability algorithm
4. **Animation**: 5-second spin with smooth easing
5. **Result**: Display congratulations dialog
6. **Save**: Record spin in GameScores list
7. **History**: Refresh user's spin history


## Performance Considerations

- **Initial Load**: < 2 seconds
- **Spin Animation**: 5 seconds
- **Data Save**: < 1 second  
- **Bundle Size**: ~400KB (minified)
- **API Calls**: 2-3 per spin operation
